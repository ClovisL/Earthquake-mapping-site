# Earthquake mapping with leaflet
Webpage that uses a JavaScript to take a GEOJSON file from the USGS website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to map out all earthquakes that happened for the day.

Circle markers are placed on the map at each location of an earthquake, with radius varying based on magnitude, and color varying based on depth, indicated by the legend.
Clicking on a marker shows the location, the magnitude, and the depth of the earthquake.

Click on the github-pages deployment to view the map or go to https://clovisl.github.io/Earthquake-mapping-site/
